- Extensive total supply by halving period :

		- block 1 - 7 			: 70 000 000 	LNCR , which 66 414 845 LNCR has been used for the old LightningCash ( LNC ) balances claims, and 3 585 155 as a new premine.
		  				  at block 48 725 , 1 682 694 coins were sent to an old exchange's admin to cover the old LNC to LNCR swap. So the true available dev premine was
						  1 902 461 LNCR.

See in explorer : block 238, 241, 248, 254, 265, 270, 272, 276, 280, 283, 286, 289, 291, 329, 344, 345, 352, 356, 360, 367, 673, and finaly 48725.


To this day, on December 14th 2024, at block height 3 707 245,     
74 634 033.75 coins have been emitted so far, 
1 766 134.75 coins have been burned in the hive, 
so 72 867 899 is the actual total supply. 
38.11 % of emitted coins have been burned. ( 1 766 134 / 4 634 033 LNCR)

It is therefore estimated that at this rate, the 21 000 000 mineable coins will all be mined on October 21st 2088, and out of those 21 000 000, around 8 003 562 coins will have been burned.
So it is estimated that when all coins will be mined, in October 2088, the total supply will be 82 996 438 LNCR.

Febrary 1st 2046 ... November 17th 2048 ... September 4th 2051
 ... June 21st 2054 ... April 7th 2057 --- January 23rd 2060 ( 12th halving )
...  October 21st 2088 ( 26th and last possible halving )

Maximum supply ( maximum theoretical possible supply, reached in October 2088, but will always be less due to coins being burned in bee creation transactions... )

	91 000 000 coins	( 70 000 000 divided as follows : 66 414 845 coins for the old LNC balance claims, 1 682 694 coins for an old exchange swap, and 1 902 461 as a new premine )
				( 21 000 000 mineable coins )

Approximately 38.11 % of coins will be burned.......

To push it even further.... since the percentage of the bee creation fee that will be burned will go down from 90 or 100 % to 50 % on January 1st 2025, blockheight 3 864 378, it is estimated
that from this blockheight, only 20 % of the emitted coins will end up being burned in the hive.
